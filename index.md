Our research focuses on quantifying how geologic setting and
infrastructure design interact. This involves numerical models implemented in
software that is capable of capturing the multiscale nature of these
interactions. We are especially interested in natural hazard modeling and
describing how infrastructure responds to this type of loading as an aggregated
system. We incorporate the latest advances made in computing technology into
open source tools that can be used by the research community as well as
practitioners. Additionally, we are working on ways to utilize advances made in
remote sensing and UAV technology such that the data acquired from these
technologies can be quickly processed and used to update model predictions.
