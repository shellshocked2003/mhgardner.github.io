### GE 385: *Geological Engineering Data Analysis*
Introduction to and application of statistical inference and probability theory
to analysis of geological engineering problems and data. This includes graphical
data analysis and sampling, elements of set theory, elements of probability
theory; random variables and expectation, simulation, and statistical
inference. These concepts are applied to a wide range of geological engineering
problems using both existing and student-generated Python code.

### GE 483: *Geological Engineering Slope Stability Analysis*
Evaluating the stability of slopes is an important and interesting aspect of
geological and geotechnical engineering. It requires an understanding of the
geological factors that affect the stability of slopes and how they may
contribute to the manner in which a slope fails. This course provides an
introduction into the process of assessing the stability of natural and
engineered slopes. This includes site investigation, soil and rock mass strength
properties, infuence of groundwater, different methods of stability assessment
for varying geologic materials, slope monitoring, and slope stabilization.

### GE 745: *Numerical Methods for Geomaterials*
The mechanical response of geological materials is both complex and highly
variableâ€”the characteristics of the solid material, such as soil or rock, will
greatly influence its mechanical properties while interaction with fluid can
have a significant impact on the overall material behavior. In this class, we
will discuss different numerical methods that can model the dynamic response of
geological materials, and when it is appropriate to apply them. For example, can
the material be modeled as a continuum or is it more appropriate to consider the
discrete behavior of individual particles? These numerical methods are
implemented in Python, though students are welcome to use any programming
language they are most comfortable with.
