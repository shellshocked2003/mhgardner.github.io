intro: 
  - excerpt: 'My research focuses on quantifying how geologic setting
       and infrastructure design interact. This involves numerical
       models implemented in software that is capable of capturing the
       multiscale nature of these interactions. I am especially
       interested in natural hazard modeling and describing how
       infrastructure responds to this type of loading as an
       aggregated system. I incorporate the latest advances made in
       computing technology into open source tools that can be used by
       the research community as well as practitioners. Additionally,
       I work on ways to utilize advances made in sensing and UAV
       technology such that the data acquired from these technologies
       can be quickly processed and used to update model predictions.'

# Dynamic Rock-Fluid Interaction

Scour of rock by hydraulically induced plucking of rock blocks from
the stream bed is an important geomorphic process in rock channel
evolution and, on a practical level, this process is a critical issue
facing many of the worldâ€™s dams at which excessive scour of the dam
foundation or spillway can compromise their performance. Numerical
modeling of rock scour is a challenging and interesting problem that
combines rock mechanics and hydraulics of turbulent flow. Our approach
has been to directly model the solid and fluid phase by representing
the individual polyhedral blocks using the Discrete Element Method
(DEM) and using the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to represent water.
The multiscale nature of rock-fluid interaction requires adaptive
meshing in a parallel computing environment so that fluid flow both
through joints and fractures, and over the rock surface are captured.
Currently, we are working on applying the coupled DEM-LBM approach on
a High Performance Computing platform such the the numerical model is
able to capture the multiscale nature of the fluid-solid interaction
with sufficient fidelity to understand mechanistically what governs
plucking.

Future potential applications include direct evaluation of the effect
of water pressure inside the fractured rock mass, along potential
sliding planes, and can be extended also to rock falls and slides into
standing bodies of water, such as lakes and reservoirs.

# Three-Dimensional Model Generation

Generating a realistic representation of a fractured rock mass is a
first step in many different analyses. Field observations need to be
translated into a 3-D model that will serve as the input for these
analyses. The block systems can contain hundreds of thousands to
millions of blocks of varying sizes and shapes; generating these large
models is very computationally expensive and requires significant
computing resources. We have taken advantage of advances made in big
data analytics and Cloud Computing and developed an open-source
program&mdash;SparkRocks&mdash;that is able to generate real-world
scale block systems containing millions of blocks in minutes and
achieve orders of magnitude speedup. Importantly, the same application
is able to run on many different computing environments&mdash;from a
laptop, to desktop, to cluster on the Cloud&mdash;so computational
requirements can be seamlessly scaled up as required.

The next phase of this research is focusing on two aspects: 1.)
Developing the ability to process various input data types, such as
UAV (drone) or LiDAR surveys, to automatically extract rock mass
characteristics and their variability and, 2.) generating stochastic
realizations of the three dimensional rock mass given the variability
extracted from the input data. The functionality of the data stream
processing and stochastic generation is being developed to be
extensible and agnostic of the application with the long-term goal of
developing a research tool that is capable of generating
three-dimensional models for various types of problems and that is
portable to many different computing platforms.
